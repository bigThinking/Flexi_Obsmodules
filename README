Flexi_OBS Modules for OMNeT++ and OMNEST
------------------------------------

Flexi_OBSmodules is a set of modules to simulate flex-spectrum and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed, Optical Burst Switched networks using the OMNeT++ framework. It is based on the OBSModules simulator at 
https://github.com/mikelizal/OBSmodules. However, it has been heavily modified to cater for new needs. It is built to be extensible, in order to allow study of various part of Optical Burst Switching.

Future work will consist of
-Improving documentation
-implementing signalling protocols such as JET
-Improving Integration with INET framework

This project requires at least Omnetpp 5.1 and INET 3.5 (20-09-2017)
